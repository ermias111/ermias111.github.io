          I am a software engineer with 1+ years of experience
           in web application development, problem-solving, 
           team-building, and team-building. I have worked on many projects 
           starting from school mini-projects to large scale projects in two local companies.

          I’m a hands-on technical developer who 
          has built software products from the ground up, 
          solved problems, and delivered new Ideas to be solved 
          with a software product. I am motivated by problem-solving, 
          product success and business growth, not just technology for technology’s sake.
